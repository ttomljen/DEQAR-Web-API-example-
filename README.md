This repository is one example of how to access data from a DEQAR database and display it in a searchable way.
The documentation used to create this example can be found at https://docs.deqar.eu/web_api/#web-api
This example is written in PHP programming language and all it takes is to upload the files to the APACHE server.
In the config.pfp document you need to enter the username, password provided by EQAR and the acronym of your agency.
